        "\n",
        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1.Encapsulation**\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, called a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is intended to prevent accidental modification and ensure that data is only changed in controlled ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** Private variables and methods within a class, only accessible through public methods (getters and setters).\n",
        "\n",
        "**2.Abstraction**\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and only exposing the necessary and relevant parts. This allows developers to focus on interactions at a high level without needing to understand every detail of how something works.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** A Car class that has a method start_engine() abstracts the details of engine ignition from the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3.Inheritance**\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behavior (methods) from another class, known as the parent or base class. This helps promote code reusability and creates a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** A Dog class can inherit from an Animal class, inheriting properties like legs and behaviors like make_sound().\n",
        "\n",
        "**4.Polymorphism**\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This is often used through method overriding, where subclasses provide specific implementations for methods defined in their parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** A Shape superclass with a draw() method can have subclasses like Circle and Square that implement their own versions of draw().\n",
        "\n",
        "**5.Association and Composition (also known as Aggregation)**\n",
        "\n",
        "While not always considered one of the “core” pillars, association and composition are key OOP concepts. Association represents a relationship between classes, and composition is a strong form of association where one class owns an instance of another class. If the owning class is destroyed, so is the owned object.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** A Library class can contain multiple Book objects (composition), but a Teacher and Student can have an association since they can exist independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts together form the foundation of OOP, enabling more modular, reusable, and scalable code."
